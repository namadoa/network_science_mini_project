# Social Media and Social Network Analysis

Tools for extracting information and constructing and analysing networks from
Twitter data (JSON). Some of these are \*nix shell scripts, some are Windows
batch files, some are python scripts. Mostly tested on Windows running cygwin.

## Purpose

This code has been written to support the analysis of social media data (Twitter
data, specifically), including to support the comparison of simultaneously
collected datasets in order to examine variations in data collection activities
and how they affect not just the datasets but also the analyses based on those
data.
